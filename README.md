## :sparkles: Definitely not an artistic website!:sparkles:

I decided that in the future I will need a little bit more of my own space in order to publish all of my "artsy" stuff. Didn't want to mix it with my professional IT website, so here it is! A simple, separate Gatsby website where I will store all my junk. It's still not entirely finished, but it already looks like it was supposed to look according to my master design figma plan.

Written with love and Gatsby :heart:

Enjoy!
