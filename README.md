## Quorum - Fashion Atelier
### https://quorum-fashion.netlify.app/

Project made for a fashion atelier made with  Gatsby. Urban and city lights as the main theme. The work is still on progress as I want to add a proper back-end for the shop itself + the payments system.

The project is still in progress, I need to still add better grids for RWD + adjust some parts of the code for other browsers and add some extra content, but you can already see the demo ;)

Enjoy!
